Fire,"Beezer always has the most warm, comforting fire in his house."
Lab,This messy room has all sorts of odd unfinished projects that Beezer has. Something tells me that it's in my best interest not to know what he's doing.
Shelf,This bookshelf is full of some of what looks to be by far the most technical books I have ever seen. It just goes to show what a brilliant mind Beezer really has.
