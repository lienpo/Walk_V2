Name,Description
Brad’s dick,"Well, he’s flaunting it too much but at least he’s obviously well endowed.  I need to look away before people notice me staring at another man’s dick…"
Jukebox,I could play something but choosing music that people won’t like in a bar this violent when I’m already as hated as I am is not a good idea.
Bathroom,No thanks. I kind of have to go but I’m not quite that desperate yet.
